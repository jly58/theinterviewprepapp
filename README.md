Overview
Description
Allows users to prepare for interviews by displaying their elevator pitch, create potential interview questions and provide answers on an app

App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

Category: Education
Mobile: A mobile app for on-the-go ideas
Story: I found in my personal experience I struggled with thinking of scenarios during interviews and having a place to jot it down in a structured space would be useful. I'm sure my peers would be more than willing to have this sort of platform when they are preparing for interviews.
Market: This is geared towards students and adults looking to prepare for job interviews.
Habit: This is mostly a creation and review app for educational purposes. It is not habit-forming and may be used sparingly to somewhat frequently depending on one's needs at the time.
Scope: May be intricate to complete with all functionalities.
